DFT/cRPA Calculations were done using VASP v6.4.2
Wannierization was done using wannier90 v3.1.0 using the VASP interface (.win files included in INCAR.cRPA)
HIA calculations were done using TRIQS, TPRF, TRIQS_HubbardI v3.2.1
DMFT calculations require TRIQS, TPRF, w2dynamics and w2dynamics_interface
